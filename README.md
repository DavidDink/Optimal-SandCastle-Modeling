So far I've only uploaded the radioactive decay file from my last year simulation course. I took an object oriented approach so it might be slightly confusing to read through at first, but I believe it's gonna be really useful for us to keep this approach, since we'll have to run the same simulation for various types of sandcastles (thus the object oriented approach)
