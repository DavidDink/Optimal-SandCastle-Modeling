So far I've only uploaded the radioactive decay file from my last year simulation course. I took an object oriented approach so it might be slightly confusing to read through at first, but I believe it's gonna be really useful for us to keep this approach, since we'll have to run the same simulation for various types of sandcastles (thus the object oriented approach)

Tonight, I'm gonna spend some time studying water waves and try to model them in a code file. So far, I believe I'll use 3 parameters as random variables under normal distributions. They will be: frequency of waves (how often one comes), height of waves and speed of waves.
